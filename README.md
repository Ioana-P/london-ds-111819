This is the cohort repo for Flatiron School's Data Science Cohort 111819!! 

Here you will find all the materials that your instructors will provide you with throughout the course.

As will be stressed the first week of class, we HIGHLY recommend that when you clone this directory on your computer that you use it exclusively for pulling materials from the instructors.
If you want to modify scripts, notebooks, code, notes, whatever that the instructors give you, please get in the habit sooner rather than later of making a separate directory where you keep track of those files.
While this might seem tedious at first, it will provide good practice for thinking about how you organize your data science projects.
