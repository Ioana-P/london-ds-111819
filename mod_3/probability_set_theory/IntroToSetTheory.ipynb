    "As discussed in the curricula, the important jump from Set Theory to probability comes in thinking about the relationship between Sample Space and Event Space.\n",

    "\n",
    "In simple terms, the probability of seeing an event $B$ in the second trial depends on the outcome $A$ of the first trial. We say that $P(B)$ is **conditional** on $P(A)$.\n",

    "While calculating the probability of the second event (event $B$) given that the primary event (event $A$) has just happened, we say that the probability of event $B$ relies on the occurrence of event $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some more examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Drawing a 2nd Ace from a deck of cards given that the first card you drew was an Ace.\n",
    "* Finding the probability of liking \"The Matrix\" given that you know this person likes science fiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that $P(A)$ is the event we are interested in, and this event depends on a certain event $B$ that has happened. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this formula may be easier if you look at two simple Venn Diagrams and use the multiplication rule. Here's how to derive this formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Write out the multiplication rule:\n",
    "* $P(A \\cap B)= P(B)*P(A\\mid B)$\n",
    "\n",

    "* $\\dfrac{P(A \\cap B)}{ P(B)} = \\dfrac{P(B)*P(A\\mid B)}{P(B)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Cancel P(B) on the right side of the equation:\n",
    "* $\\dfrac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} = P(A \\mid B)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: This is of course equal to:\n",
    "* $ P(A \\mid B)=\\dfrac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} $\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is our conditional probability formula. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few variations and theorems that are related to and/or results of this conditional probability formula. The most important ones are: the **product rule**, the **chain rule** and **Bayes Theorem**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 1 - Product Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The **product rule** was used to derive the conditional probability formula above, but is often used in situations where the conditional probability is easy to compute, but the probability of intersections of events isn't. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intersection of events $A$ and $B$ can be given by\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    P(A \\cap B) = P(B) P(A \\mid B) = P(A) P(B \\mid A)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that if $A$ and $B$ are independent, then conditioning on $B$ means nothing (and vice-versa) so $P(A|B) = P(A)$, and $P(A \\cap B) = P(A) P(B)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 2 - Chain Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The **chain rule** (also called the **general product rule**) permits the calculation of any member of the joint distribution of a set of random variables using only conditional probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the product rule: \n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A \\cap B) = P(A \\mid B) P(B)$\n",
    "\n",
    "When you extend this for three variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A\\cap B \\cap C) = P(A\\cap( B \\cap C)) = P(A\\mid B \\cap C) P(B \\cap C) = P(A \\mid B \\cap C) P(B \\mid C) P(C)$\n",
    "\n",
    "And you can keep extending this to $n$ variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A_1 \\cap A_2 \\cap \\ldots \\cap A_n) = P(A_1 \\mid A_2 \\cap \\ldots\\cap A_n) P(A_2 \\mid A_3  \\cap \\ldots \\cap \\ A_n) P(A_{n-1}|A_n) P(A_n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea is known as the **chain rule**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If on the other hand you have disjoint events $C_1, C_2,...,C_m$ such that $C_1\\cup C_2\\cup Â·Â·Â· \\cup  C_m = \\Omega$, the probability of any event can be decomposed as:\n",
